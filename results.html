These insects attach themselves to the skin of mammals, including humans, to feed on their blood. Tick bites can sometimes transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and anaplasmosis. Ticks are often found in grassy or wooded areas and can be difficult to spot due to their small size.For more information, visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_disease\">Wikipedia page on Tick-borne disease</a>.",
                    "precautions": "Avoid Tick Habitats: When hiking or spending time in grassy or wooded areas, wear long sleeves, long pants, and tuck your pants into your socks to reduce skin exposure. Use Tick Repellents: Apply insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide) or other EPA-approved ingredients to exposed skin and clothing. Perform Tick Checks: After spending time outdoors, thoroughly check your body and clothing for ticks, especially in areas like the scalp, behind the ears, and between the legs. Proper Tick Removal: If you find a tick attached to your skin, remove it promptly using fine-tipped tweezers. Grasp the tick as close to the skin's surface as possible and pull upward with steady, even pressure. Clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Monitor for Symptoms: Watch for signs of tick-borne diseases, such as fever, rash, or flu-like symptoms. If you develop any symptoms after a tick bite or if the tick bite site becomes red, swollen, or develops a rash, seek medical attention promptly."

                    description:"Chitons, commonly known as coat-of-mail shells or sea cradles, belong to the class Polyplacophora. These marine mollusks are characterized by their distinctive eight-plated shells that provide flexibility and protection. Chitons are usually found on rocky shorelines, clinging tightly to surfaces with their muscular foot. They primarily feed on algae, using their radula (a toothed, tongue-like organ) to scrape it off rocks. Chitons have a simple body structure with a ventral foot for locomotion and a dorsal shell for protection.For more details, visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiton\">Wikipedia article on Chiton</a>.",
                    precautions:"Handle with Care:When observing or handling chitons, do so gently to avoid harming them. They have a strong attachment to rocks and forcefully removing them can cause injury."
